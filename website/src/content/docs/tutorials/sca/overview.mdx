title: Side Channel Attacks Overview
description: Side Channel Attacks Overview
---

Side channel attacks (SCA) and side channel analysis (conveniently also SCA)
study how to correlate data dependent computation characteristics (e.g.,
timing, power consumption or electromagnetic emissions) to secret values. There
is a rich body of research in this area. For some evaluations large amounts of
data are needed.

At the [CHES 24 OPTIMIST workshop](https://optimist-ose.org/workshop-24) an
initiative for [Open Tools, Interfaces and Metrics for Implementation Security
Testing (OPTIMIST)](https://optimist-ose.org/) started. One of the outcomes
being a call for format for trace storage. In this series of tutorials we argue
that Sedpack is a viable solution for this purpose. If you have any questions,
feature suggestions or patches see [sedpack GitHub
repository](https://github.com/google/sedpack).

The **sedpack** project started as a refactor and evolution of the data storage
system used by **SCAAML (Side Channel Attacks Assisted with Machine
Learning)**. See the [SCAAML website](https://google.github.io/scaaml/) or the
[SCAAML GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/scaaml/).

## What's Next

For the purposes of exposition we mainly focus on the very easy dataset of
power consumption measurements of a textbook [AES
(Wikipedia)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
implementation. This dataset is both publicly available and easy to attack
(analyze). If you know side channel attacks feel free to skip to the next
sections otherwise you might choose to read through the following blog-posts:

-   [A Hacker Guide To Deep Learning Based Side Channel
    Attacks](https://elie.net/talk/a-hackerguide-to-deep-learning-based-side-channel-attacks)
    a video of DefCon 27 (2019) talk introducing SCAAML.
-   [Hacker's guide to deep-learning side-channel attacks: the
    theory](https://elie.net/blog/security/hacker-guide-to-deep-learning-side-channel-attacks-the-theory)
    a gentle introduction to the theory.
-   [Hacker's guide to deep-learning side-channel attacks: code
    walkthrough](https://elie.net/blog/security/hacker-guide-to-deep-learning-side-channel-attacks-code-walkthrough)
    the very first version of the SCAAML model. Later in this series of
    tutorials we use our most recent model on the same dataset.

In this series of tutorials we showcase how the sedpack storage can be
leveraged to help with side channel analysis. This series is not a
one-solution-fits fully fledged side channel framework. The point is to
showcase a tool designed to do one thing well (data storage) and enables others
to work together using as universal interface as possible. We will see that
different forms of iteration (randomly shuffled or just plain iteration)
possibly with batching (yielding several examples at once) provides a ground
for both machine learning as well as classical attack needs.

## Existing Tools

There is a variety of excellent tools for side channel analysis. Most of which
provide not only storage capabilities but also side channel analysis tools.
This provides an advantage of being ready to use. On the other hand storing
data in one of those $N$ tools and using algorithms from another creates an $N
\times N$ compatibility matrix (with the diagonal hopefully being trivial). Our
goal is to make one storage tool which can be then used by other tools. And
thus saving a significant amount of duplicated work.

### An Incomplete List of Existing Tools

We acknowledge that the following list is incomplete.  In fact it is our hope
that it is incomplete as we hope this list will be growing.  In an alphabetical
order:

-   [LASCAR](https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/lascar)
-   [SCARR](https://github.com/decryptofy/scarr)
-   [riscure](https://www.keysight.com/ch/de/products/network-test/device-vulnerability-analysis.html)

If we forgot your tool and you want it to be listed here please open an issue
or send us a pull request.
